-------------------------------------
This is a custom script that processes raw reads. The script acts BOTH as a wrapper for other published software as well as a script that processes and reformats data for downstream applications.

GENERAL OUTPUT FILE FORMATS:

All OTU related files are indicated *otu*.
All ZOTU related files are indicated *zotu*.
Single read equivalents are indicated *R1* and *R2*.


Output file of OTU clustering: otus.fa


OTU table formats
    OTU table*: otutable_notax.txt
    OTU table with taxonomy information: otutable.txt
    OTU table normalized to 1000 reads per sample: otutable_notax.norm1000.txt

    * The otus.fa and zotus.fa are required for running 
      the a postiori taxonomy assignment function. Single read variants are also accepted input.

VERSION HISTORY

AmpProc5 v5.2.0.beta2.0
Released for user evaluation:
- Following is the update status of the reference databases
   - MiDAS 2.1.3 = unchanged
   - MiDAS 3.3 = newly implemented
   - SILVA LTP = upgraded to v132
   - RDP training set v16 = unchanged
   - UNITE fungi = updated to v8.0  (ITS 1 and 2)
   - UNITE eukaryotes = newly implemented  (ITS 1 and 2)
- Added general workflow progress log file
- Added an input parameters log file so users have a record of what parameters they used in each run.
- Failure to properly build a zotu table under certain situations is now fixed, and zotu tables are properly generated.
- Updated Usearch10 to Usearch11
   - Replaced otutab_norm (obsolete) with otutab_rare.
- "usearch10 -cluster_agg" will remain default for generating the fungal cluster tree that is used to generate the unifrac matrices. Usearch11 no longer supports "-cluster_agg" but this is the recommended way to generate the tree prior to running unifrac for fungi.
- Fixed the issue where some of the representative reads were being excluded from the phylogenetic tree.

AmpProc5 v5.1.0.beta1.0
Released for user evaluation: 10 September 2019
- Officially changed the script name to AmpProc5
- Added the MiDAS 3 ASVs workflow as an option

amplicon.workflow_v5.0.3.beta1.0.sh
Released for user evaluation: 2 November 2018
- Added user environment configuration check to make sure that proper temporary folders are present for the QIIME steps.
- Added alias AmpProc5 as an executable command to run the script.
- Changed default number of threads used to 5 (originally 15) to account for the smaller servers.
- Polished the Help description


amplicon.workflow_v5.0.2.beta1.1.sh
Released for user evaluation: 21 March 2018 
- Fixed the biom convert command, added the format parameter so the command works on Qiime 1.9.0
- Moved the prefilter step to after otu clustering, and lowered stringency, in order to speed up this step.

amplicon.workflow_v5.0.1.sh
Released for user evaluation: 12 March 2018
- Fixed a bug in the taxonomy formatting of the final otutable.txt and zotutable.txt, where missing taxonomy levels in the middle of a taxonomy string were not recognized.
- Added version history information in the README file


amplicon.workflow_v5.0.sh
Released for user evaluation: 7 February 2018
Major upgrade since version 4.3
